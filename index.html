            Structure: The interface should be organized, putting related elements together.
            Simple: Common tasks should be easy.
            Visible: Information and options should be easy to find, without the distraction of unnecessary information.
            Feedback: Users should be informed of actions, changes in state, and errors.
            Tolerance: Mistakes should be easy to undo and reasonable input should be interpreted.
            Reuse: Design should be consistent across components.
            To help you get started with the design process, answer the following questions. Your instructor may ask you to record answers to these in an engineering notebook:
          
          
            <br>How many pages will your site have?
            <br> 3
            <br>What will be the primary function of each individual page?
            <br>   gallery, login, home
            <br>How will your user navigate between pages?
            <br>   buttons
            <br>How will information about images and pieces be displayed?
            <br>    artist, date, caption
            <br>What information about images, pieces, and/or artists will be displayed?
            <br>   artist, date, caption
            <br>Where will they be displayed?
            <br>    gallery
            <br>How will the different parts of your site look?
            <br>    login has login, gallery has images, and home is the front page
            <br>By what criteria should a user be able to search for images?
            <br>    artist, date, caption
            <br>How will they enter those criteria?
            <br>    search bar
            <br>Draw a sketch of what your site would look like.
